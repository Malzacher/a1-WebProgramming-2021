         <h1> What is Yoga?</h1>
         <p>Generally, it is recognised as an ancient system of philosophies, principles and practices derived from the
            Vedic tradition of India and the Himalayas, more than 2500 years ago. It is a system that recognises the
            multi-dimensional nature of the human person, and primarily relates to the nature and workings of the mind,
            based on experiential practice and self-enquiry.</p>
         <p>In Yoga, the body, breath and mind are seen as a union of these multi-dimensional aspects of each and every
            human being. The system and various techniques of Yoga cultivate the experience of that union, leading to
            greater integration of being, internal peacefulness, and clarity of the mind. It is a system that is
            designed to cultivate health and happiness, and a greater sense of self-awareness and higher consciousness.
         </p>
         <p>Yoga cultivates health and wellbeing (physical, emotional, mental and social) through the regular practice
            of a range of many different techniques, including postures and movement, breath awareness and breathing
            exercises, relaxation<br> and concentration, self-inquiry and meditation.</p>
         <p>Yoga is an approach to life that values appropriate effort, based on balance and <br> harmony, within each
            person and with each other.</p>
