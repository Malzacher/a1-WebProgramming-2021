      <h1>What are Healthy Habbits?</h1>
      <p>A behaviour that is beneficial to one’s physical or mental health, often linked to a high level of discipline
         and self-control
         Examples good habits Regular exercise, consumption of alcohol in moderation, balanced diet, monogamy, etc.
         Examples bad habits Smoking, drug abuse, gambling, sexual promiscuity, poor sleep hygiene, high fat-, high red
         meat diet</p>
      <h3>3 healthy Habits to implement:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>STAY ACTIVE:Physical activity is beneficial for overall health – and that includes bladder and bowel
            function! Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity per day. This doesn’t have to be all at once.
            Activities like gardening, cleaning, playing with the grandkids, and taking the stairs all add up.</li> <br>
         <li>EAT WELL: Fibre in your diet will help improve bowel function and avoid constipation. Fibre is found in
            foods such as multi grain or whole grain breads, cereal products, fruit, vegetables, legumes, and nuts and
            seeds. Aim to eat two servings of fruit, <br> five servings of vegetables and five servings of cereals and
            breads
            each day. You <br> are what you eat, and eating well can make a world of difference to how we feel<br> and
            how our
            bodies</li><br>
         <li>GET ENOUGH FLUIDS AND DRINK WELL: It’s important to increase fluids when you <br> increase fibre in your
            diet.
            Drinking plenty of water and staying hydrated helps <br> maintain digestive health. Drinks that contain
            caffeine,
            cola and alcohol can <br> irritate your bladder, so water is the best choice. While our tendency when
            dealing
            with bladder and bowel problems might be to restrict our liquid intake, this is actually the opposite of
            what we should do.</li>
      </ul>
